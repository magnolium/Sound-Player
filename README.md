# SoundPlayer
Intended to give phone (web) access to a soundboard on the Raspberry Pi over the network.
<br><br>
This was created for a very specific purpose.
<br><br>
<h2>Install</h2>
Index.php goes in <i>/www/</i> folder of Apache and everything else goes as is in <i>/Desktop/soundplayer/</i> folder. Mp3's may be added/removed from the folder, no changes to the code are required. All that is needed is a restart.
