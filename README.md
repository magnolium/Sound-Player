# Sound-Player
Intended to give phone (web) access to a soundboard on the Raspberry Pi over the network.

<br>
Any sounds that are placed/removed from the sounds directory will be automatically added/removed from the soundboard. All that is required is a restart.<br><br>

Index.php goes in <i>/www/</i> folder and everything else goes as is in <i>/Desktop/soundplayer/</i> folder.
